# Schedule Helper (2020)

Schedule Helper is a Python 3.8 program designed specifically for teachers and deputy heads of schools. The program helps to systematize the information necessary for compiling schedules, and in future versions, data validation will be implemented (i.e., the program will inform the user about errors). To run the program, PyCharm and Python 3.8 need to be installed (they are already included in the project folder).

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program features a user-friendly interface with six tabs containing different tables, facilitating interaction with the user.
- **Data Persistence:** Inputted data is immediately saved to the database (DB) and automatically displayed in other tables.
- **Database Integration:** The program utilizes an SQLite database, named "DataBase.db," which is included in the project folder.
- **Error Handling (Future Implementation):** Future versions of the program will include data validation, alerting users about any input errors.

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure PyCharm and Python 3.8 are installed on your system.
2. **Open Project:** Open the project folder in PyCharm.
3. **Run Program:** Execute the main Python script to launch the program.

## Note
- **Incomplete Functionality:** Please note that the program is not yet fully developed and lacks several features necessary for complete functionality. However, significant progress has been made within a short timeframe, providing valuable experience in Python programming, as well as working with libraries such as PyQT5 and SQLite3.
